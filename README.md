## Description

Following along with the [Deadalous Community videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3B56ql_akNcvH8vvJRYOc7TbYhRs19M).

Instead of continually updating the same 'boot.asm', I decided to start a new file for each major advancement. If you're also following along, it should be pretty easy to match up my filenames to each video.

## Notes

`[org 0x7c00]` offset is to account for the "Interrupt Vector Table" of the BIOS. Thanks to @snehashishkarmakar3376 for the explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hseFqtRpK0M&lc=Ugy3IHBUgbrh8oEVJa54AaABAg
